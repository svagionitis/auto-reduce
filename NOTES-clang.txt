I installed clang with 'sudo apt-get install clang'
(I'll need a cross-clang for real work.)

to use the analyzer, do:
 $ scan-build make

No matter what I do, it doesn't generate any analysis reports
 (I tried obvious_bug, with a null-pointer dereference, and it didn't catch it.)


'clang -S -emit-llvm foo.c' produces foo.s with LLVM IR data
'clang -cc1 foo.c -emit-llvm' produces foo.ll with LLVM IR data
 - the output from the abve two commands was almost identical
'llc foo.ll' produces foo.s with assembly data

-cc1 causes -ast-print to be used
'clang -cc1 -- help' has more information

.bc is also an extension recognized for LLVM IR data

'llc -mach=c foo.ll? -o foo.c


bc = 'bitcode', I think
