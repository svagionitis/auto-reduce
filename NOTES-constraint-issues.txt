For the uid0 constraint:

current_uid_gid() is hard to deal with, so I removed all references to it
(replacing it with individual calls to current_uid() and current_gid().

There were only two places this was needed:
 * kernel/auditsc.c:audit_log_abend()
 * net/core/dev.c:__dev_set_promiscuity()

 * include/linux/cred.h was also modified, to remove the macro
