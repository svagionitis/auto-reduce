This repository contains the tools and notes from Tim Bird's
Linux auto-reduce research.

This was a project conducted while Tim worked for Sony Corporation,
to research different non-traditional methods for reducing
the size of the Linux kernel.  A presentation on this research
was made at LinuxCon Japan in May, 2013.

The presentation can be found online here:

Have fun!
